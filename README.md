# next-js-blog
Welcome to next-js-blog, a simple blog project designed to introduce you to the Next.js framework. This project is intended for beginners who are looking to get started with these technologies and build a basic blog.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository and 
```console
run npm install 
```
to install the necessary dependencies. Then 
```console
run npm run dev
```
run npm run dev to start the development server. The application should be available at [here](http://localhost:3000).

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

* _pages_: This directory contains the application's pages, with each page represented by a separate file.
* _components_: This directory contains reusable components that can be used across multiple pages.
* _posts_:  this folder contains articles in the form of structured '.md' files that will be extracted and published on our blog.
* _public_: This directory contains static assets such as images and fonts that are served directly by the server.

### Questions or Feedback

If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to let me know.
